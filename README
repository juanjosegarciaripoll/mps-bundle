INTRODUCTION
============

This is a wrapper project that installs the mps and tensor libraries in a
self-contained location, downloading them and building them with whatever
systems are available in your computer. It also allows for rebuilding the
software only when changes were done in the original repositories.

INSTALLATION
============

No installation required. Type

   # make build

from the command line and it will start the process of downloading and
configuring the software. At later times do 'make build' again and the
system will re-compile itself.

The software will be installed in the bin/, include/, lib/ and shared/
directories within mps-bundle, which means you can run this from your
own home directory.

Once the software is built and installed, you can use the directory
'project/' to configure a Makefile that builds your programs. This file
is customized for our group's needs, but it should be general enough
for other purposes.
